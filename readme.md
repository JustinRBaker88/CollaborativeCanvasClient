# Collaborative Canvas - Drawing Web App

Collaborative Canvas is a personal project of mine implementing an interactive web application inspired by [Reddit's \/r\/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit) "Reddit's /r/place"). Collaborative Canvas is implemented using Typescript, HTML5, CSS, & [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser "Phaser 3").
